# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### A CityBikes API was used to access public bike systems systems in Toronto.
### CityBike url: http://api.citybik.es/v2/


### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
One of the main challenges with the model was transforming the dependent and independent variables into a normal distribution.
Outliers, or even a high amount of zeros in the distributions made it difficult to normalize even after taking the natural logarithm.
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
If I had more time I would not make the review counts and review scores
independent variables, and instead normalize them into a weighted sum column.
This way the magnitude of the score will also be proportional to the number
of reviews given, (e.g. a 5 star rating with more reviews than another 5 star
rating will have a higher magnitude).

(what would you do if you had more time?)
